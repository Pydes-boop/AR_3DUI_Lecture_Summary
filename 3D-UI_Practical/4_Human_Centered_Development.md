# Human centered Development

## XR and the search for the killer app
- Generally there are very few AR usages in Consumers Products that are readily used by everyone
- Social acceptance is not as high
- very niche target consumer audience for AR
- high stepping stone to learn AR interaction for what?

## Use-Cases
Problem: How to understand users needs and goals
Solution: User-centered research

- The goal of a user is not to use your product !
- Goal $\neq$ Use Case
### **BPMN** 
- tool for user task analysis (Control Flow Diagram for Task Analysis)
### Enviromental Analysis
- analysing the surrounding market / situation around your software idea
### Personas
- not real people
- depict carefully researched and designed archetypes
	→ can be used for **acceptance evaluation**
	→ can be reused by marketing
	→ avoid design for edge cases
	→ act as point of communication for Dev Team
#### Examples for Car-Personas:

| Allessandro | Marge          | Dale           |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Go Fast     | Be Safe        | Haul big loads |
| Have fun!   | be comfortable | be reliable    |
#### How to Design a Persona?
- start a hypothesis
- conduct in person interviews
- refine hypothesis
- sometimes its not possible to design complete personas → label provisional results as such
- it is better to write down biased assumptions (to be corrected) than to have unconcious bias
#### Approach
1. Write down hypothesis about goals of target group in respect to problem
2. Talk to people of the target group or research to reflect upon hypothesis
3. verbalize ad-hof personas with **behavioral patterns** and **goals**

# 3D Data structures
- 3D Geometrical Representations (Voxels, Meshes, Pointclouds)
- 3D Data Formats (.obj, .stl, .fbx)
- Object-oriented Formats (IFC, USD, GLTF)

## Surface-based Data Structures (Meshes)
- Movies, Games, Engineering applications
- simple geometries consisting of triangles
- supported by most 3D Tools and hardware level graphic cards
- or CAD-World **Step**

## Volumetric Representations (Voxels / Octrees)
- useful for non-surface oriented applications
- Computer-Tomography
- Densities and volumetric rendering
- only discrete representation and storage-intense

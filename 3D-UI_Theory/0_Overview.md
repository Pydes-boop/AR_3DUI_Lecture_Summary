# Introduction to 3D User Interfaces
- Computers can help us analyze, explore and understand information (Expand our Experience)

## Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

![[HCI.svg]]

→ **User** perceives and interprets
→ **System** interprets input to output

→ System amplifies User in Tasks / Intelligence

## Concepts
#### WIMP GUIs (since 1970s)
*WIMP*: Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers
*GUI*: Graphical User Interface
#### Non-WIMP UIs (since 1980s)
*Input*: Speech, Gestures, [[5_Trackers|Trackers]], [[5_Trackers#Sensors|Sensors]]
*Output*: [[7_Displays#Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)|Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)]], Heads-Up Display (HUD), 3D-Graphics, Sounds, Haptics
*Computer*: Networked interaction between Systems, Peer-to-peer, client-server

#### 3D User Interface
- "UI that involves 3D interaction"
	→ Interactive Systems with 3D Graphics but no 3D Interaction
	→ 3D Interaction with a classical 2D Input
	→ 3D Interaction with non-spatial Input (eg. Speech)

- **Focus** here is on interaction using 3D Spatial Input

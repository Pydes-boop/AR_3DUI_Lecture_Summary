# Wayfinding

## Design Guidelines
1. Match the cue to the task
2. Match cue to user skill
3. Cues should **not** be dominant features
4. avoid teleportation
5. integrate travel and wayfinding components
## Wayfinding Tasks
**Exploration:** 
- Acquitision of Spatial Knowledge

**Search:**
- Use of pre-existing spatial konwledge
- Acquisiton of further (directed or undirected) Spatial knowledge

**Manouvering:**
- small scale movements, e.g. for the identification within a region

→ similar to [[2_Travel#Travel Tasks|Travel Tasks]] 
## Spatial Knowledge
**Landmark Knowledge:**
- Visual Characteristics of the enviroment

**Procedural Knowledge (route knowledge):**
- Sequence of actions

**Survey Knowledge:**
- Topological Knowledge of Eniorment
- Highest Level of Knowledge → takes the longest to acquire

## Reference Frames
**Egocentric:**
- Headcentric / First Person centric reference frame for knowledge (landmarks, proc-knowledge: route)

**Exocentric:**
- relative to a foreign object or world (survey knowledge: map)

Transition: Egocentric → Exocentric when knowledge is acquired from Wayfinding

## Wayfinding Support
### User-centered
1. Motion Cues: avoid sensory conflicts
2. Multisensory Output: Audio (Enviroment/Objects), Tactility
3. Presence ("Feeling of being there"): better immersion creates better retention of information
4. Search Strategies: Teach user specific search strategies for objective (along coastline, landmarks, ...)

→ generally small FOV creates general disadvantages / discomfort for User → better starting point is big FOV

### Enviroment-centered
#### Enviroment Design
- Examples: Zelda, Elden Ring, Residen Evil VIII
- use analogs akin to urban design principles (Paths, Edges, Districts, Nodes, Landmarks, Repetitive Structures)
- natural enviroment (horizon for directional information, atmospheric fog for distances)
- color and texture (lead with a yellow brick road)
- architectual design (special illuminaton, put a door where you want user to go)

#### Artificial Cues
1. Maps (**exocentric** representation → survey knowledge)
2. compasses (directional cues)
3. signs (effective when used sparingly, otherwise information overload)
4. well-known reference objects (coin, matchbox, chair, person for referncing size / distance)
5. Artifical Landmarks (Dark Souls II used many of these to give a fake senes of orientation in the world)
6. Trails (duh)

#### Evaluating Wayfinding Aids
1. Time-to-target measurement
2. path analysis (like real world, build a path from the way people actually take)
3. layout sketches by user

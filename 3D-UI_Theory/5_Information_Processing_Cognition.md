# Human Cognition
## Information Processing
- generally limited processing resources/capacity while perception is very fast
#### Attention
1. Selective Attention - choosing what to process
2. Focued attention - effort to minimize outside factors while processing
3. Divided Attention - ability to process multiple stimuli at a given poitn in time
   
→ Bottlenecks/Errors can occur through limits on our sensory system, **Overstimulation**
→ remove distracting factors
→ combining multiple different stimuli can be too much for multitasking

#### Speed and accurate Reaction Dependency
1. Stimulus-response compability
2. Stimulus-response consistency
3. Number of paralell tasks
4. Uncertainty
5. Pre-cueing

## Cognition
- **Cognition** as the dirving force between generation and usage of knowledge
- Working-Memory vs. Longterm-Memory can influence results

#### Evaluating Cognitive Issues
1. Mental Load (task difficulty, attention / processing resources, resource allocation)
2. Human Error (lack of success, memory/sensory/motoric limitations)

→ [[3_Evaluation#NASA-TLX (Task Load Index)|NASA-TLX]] as a subjective Measure
→ task to draw/tell you what they remember
→ measure stress from body responses

# Summary of AR and 3D-Lecture
Augmented Reality (AR) lecture notes and practical notes as well as Three Dimensional User Interfaces (3D UI) lecture notes and practical notes from the TUM courses.
You can either view the markdown files via obsidian or just view the generated PDFs directly.

These notes are in a combined repository as many of the topics in these lectures overlap.

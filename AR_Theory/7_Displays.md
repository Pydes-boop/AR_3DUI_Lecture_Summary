## Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)

### Overview
- Ian Sutherland in 1986 creates first HMD
- since then a number of different approaches have been created
- mainly VR goggles and AR glasses

### Technological Issues
- System Latency
- Discrepancy between Human FOV and small HMD FOV
- Resolution vs FOV
- High cost

### Human Factors
1. **User Acceptance and Safety:** Will anyone wear this for extended Periods? Lack of Trust from Video Recording, Not seeing faces of other people, ...
2. **Depth Perception:** Possible Discrepancies between perceived location and actual location because of stereo imaging
3. **Adaptation:** Recovery after HMD use? Duration? 
4. **Depth of Field:** smaller Depth of Field can lead to increased dizziness â†’ accomodations

## Other Displays for AR

### Limitations of Current HMDs
1. Resolution
2. Field of View
3. Contrast
4. Weight
5. Cables
6. User Comfort
7. Shared Viewing

### Options
1. Portable Displays (Tablets, Phones)
2. Stationary Monitors (Intelligent Enviroments, Wall-mounted Displays)
3. On real Objects (Virtual Showcase / Augmenting Experience with Visuals)
